# Number Theory in Cryptography
    - Used for generation of specific numbers required for cyrptographic operations
## Public Key Crypto
    - Algorithm such as RSA encryption
    - RSA
        - Popular and secure cryptographic algorithm that encrypts and decrypts data.
        - Known public ket or asymmetric criptographic algorithm

## Digital Signatures
    - Elliptic curves
    - Helps in authenticating the sender to prevent any man in the middle attacks

## Pseudorandom Number Generation
    - Helps you design algorithms that generate unpredicatble sequences of numbers used mainly for encryption keys and other cryptographic operations
    - Refers to an algorithm that uses mathematical formulas to produce sequences of random numbers
    - Starts from an arbitrary state using a 'seed state'
    - Numbers are deterministic and efficient
