Goals for today (February 15, 2025)
1. I want to transfer my cryptography files in a GitHub repository. I have to figure out how to commit that using ubuntu directly if that is possible.
2. I want to go over the projects we did from the first week to the latest. And make sure that I am able to practice and apply it.
3. Figure out where to send the assignments, (because honestly, I haven't submitted anything since I wasn't sure how or where to submit it.)
