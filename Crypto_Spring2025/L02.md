## BigNum
    - Caclculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are potentially limited only by the available memory of the host system

## Stdint
    - Standard C library header that defines fixed-width integer types. It provides a convinient and portable way to ensure integers have specific widths across different platforms
    - the '.h' extension stands for header
        - Header files in C and C++ contain declarations of functions, macros, variables and other elementss, which can be included in multiple source files using #include directive.

### Commonly Used Types
 int8_t: Signed 8-bit integer.
```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int8_t my_int8 = -128; // Minimum value for int8_t
    printf("Signed 8-bit integer: %d\n", my_int8);
    return 0;
}
```

uint8_t: Unsigned 8-bit integer.
```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    uint8_t my_uint8 = 255; // Maximum value for uint8_t
    printf("Unsigned 8-bit integer: %u\n", my_uint8);
    return 0;
}
```

int16_t: Signed 16-bit integer.
```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int16_t my_int16 = -32768; // Minimum value for int16_t
    printf("Signed 16-bit integer: %d\n", my_int16);
    return 0;
}
```

uint16_t: Unsigned 16-bit integer.
```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    uint16_t my_uint16 = 65535; // Maximum value for uint16_t
    printf("Unsigned 16-bit integer: %u\n", my_uint16);
    return 0;
}
```

int32_t: Signed 32-bit integer.

uint32_t: Unsigned 32-bit integer.

int64_t: Signed 64-bit integer.

uint64_t: Unsigned 64-bit integer. 

#### Mnemonic Devices
    - Think of the prefix int for integer and uint for unsigned integer
    - The number in the type name represents the bit-width. For example, int32_t means a 32-bit signed integer.

#### Practical Use
    - Whenever you need a varibale with a specific size, remember to use <stdint.h> this ensures your code is portable and consistend across different systems.

#### Consistency Across Platforms
    - Portability
        Different systems might have different sizes for standard integer types (like int and long). Using fixed width types ensures your code behaves consistently acorss different hardware and compilers
#### Readability
    - Explicit Sizes
        When you use types like int32_t or uint8_t, it's immediatley clear how many bits each type uses. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain
#### Preventing Errors
    - Avoid Overflows
        By choosing the appropriate type, you can avoid potential overflow issues. For example, using uint32_t ensures you have a 32-bit unsigned integer, which helps prevent unexpected behaviour due to overflow.
#### Example: Network Protocols
    - Data Exchange
        When working with network protocols or file formats where the data structure is defined in terms of specific bit widths, using fixed-width types ensures that your data matches the required format exactly
```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct Packet {
    uint8_t version;     // 8-bit version number
    uint16_t length;     // 16-bit length of the packet
    uint32_t checksum;   // 32-bit checksum
};

int main() {
    struct Packet packet;
    packet.version = 1;
    packet.length = 100;
    packet.checksum = 1234567890;

    printf("Packet Version: %u\n", packet.version);
    printf("Packet Length: %u\n", packet.length);
    printf("Packet Checksum: %u\n", packet.checksum);

    return 0;
}
``` 
Integers
    - We can write them in python using 'itertools'

```python
from itertools import count
N = count()
make_z = lambda n : n // 2 if n % 2 else -n // 2
Z = (make_z(n) for n in count(1))
# We can see elements of these infinite collections with
[next(N) for _ in range(5)], [next(Z) for _ in range(5)]
```
#### Generator in Python
    - Are a powerful tool for creating iterators.
    - A special type of function that returns an iterator object.

#### Itertools

```powershell
make_z = lambda n: n // 2
```
half of those numbers have to be negative

```python
from itertools import count

def make_z(n):
    return n // (2 * (n % 2) - 1)

# Using a generator expression to apply make_z to the first 10 integers
z = (make_z(n) for n in range(10))

# Convert to list to see the output
print(list(z))
```
create a generator = z
